***Agenda meeting: 18/03/2019***

**Attendance**.

This meeting will first start by making sure Demo #2 works perfectly, and presenting it to TA Eric. Once Demo #2 is done, our goal will be to organize Demo #3. Improving/finishing off the Transportation section and working on other sections. Demo #3 asks for an implementation of the CoolClimate API and friendships comparison "Track and compare with friends CO2". 

Demo #3 is a rather large deadline with many ways to reach it. 

**1- Sprint Review:**

*The idea is to take 3/5 minutes for each person to answer the questions and then any question/comment from the other members can be addressed*

	1. What did you work on this week?
	2. Are there any impediments in your way?
	3. What direction do you think we should aim for?
	4. Are there any improvements to be done?

**2- Sprint Planning**

	1. When is our next deadline?
	2. What do we need to deliver?
	3. Can we break down the tasks?
	4. Assign tasks to team
	5. Organize scrum board

**3- Sprint Retrospective:**

	1. What did we do last week?
	2. We have Demo #2 but was there a way to be more efficient?
	
**4- Individul Points to Discuss**

    1. Profile
    2. Getting History (food/friends/etc...) from the Database
    3. Transportation
