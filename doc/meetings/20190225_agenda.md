***Agenda meeting on 25/02/2019***

First of all, register **attendance**.

**1- Sprint Review:**

*It should be a collaborative effort so if anybody has anything to say wrt the work of another member, feel free to discuss it*

*The idea is to take 3/5 minutes for each person to answer the questions and then any question/comment from the other members can be addressed*

Each team member should answer those three questions:

	1. What did you work on this week?
	2. What will you work on next week?
	3. Are there any impediments in your way?

_Address small problems before they turn into bigger problems, open up and discuss it_

**2- Sprint Retrospective:**

	1. What could have been improved in the last sprint?
	2. What went well?
	
**3- Sprint Planning**

	1. When is our next deadline?
	2. What do we need to deliver?
	3. Can we break down the tasks?
	4. Assign tasks to team

**4- Extra**

	1. We should spend some time to set up Neha's working environment so we can be all on the same page
	2. Transition to Gradle, Ilya can show how it works
