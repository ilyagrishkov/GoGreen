***Agenda meeting on 11/03/2019***

First of all, register **attendance**.

The goal for the meeting is to have a working Demo#2 (find more details about requirements in the guideline). Therefore, the initial focus of the meeting will be on the Demo, assuring everything is running as expected.

**1- Sprint Review:**

*The idea is to take 3/5 minutes for each person to answer the questions and then any question/comment from the other members can be addressed*

Each team member should answer those two questions:

	1. What did you work on this week?
	2. Are there any impediments in your way?

**2- Sprint Planning**

	1. When is our next deadline?
	2. What do we need to deliver?
	3. Can we break down the tasks?
	4. Assign tasks to team

**3- Sprint Retrospective:**

In the last meetings we did not have a moment to step back from the details and have a general overview of the progress in the project. Also, the scrum master should comment on our performance in regards to the _SCRUM_ board.

	1. What could have been improved in the last sprint?
	2. What went well?
	
**4- Extra**

	1. Ideas, problems, comments
    2. Spring JPA DB integration: it is worth going through the organization of the code and how to work with it
    3. Discuss about mappings (badges and achievements)
