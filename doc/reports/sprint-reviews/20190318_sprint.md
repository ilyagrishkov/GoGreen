# Sprint review 18/03/2019

### Goals achieved

* Demo 2 is completed - 0.6 points received
* Mappings for profile and food section are done
* Checkstyle is almost error free
* GUI is less messy code-wise
* Transportation section is almost done
* Cleaning and merging branches


### Main problems encountered

#### 1. Mapping is not a problem, testing is

We need to figure out how to use Mockito since tests need to not relay on the database anymore.
#### 2. No answer for CoolClimate API

We received no answer from them, so if we don't receive one in the next few days, we'll look for solutions.

#### 3. Server issues with heroku

We need to manually upload the server code from gitlab to heroku once it's approved, and this is a little hassle, since sometimes it fails and to test it, you have to deploy multiple times.

### Adjustments from previous sprint reviews

* The merge request discussions make more sense now
* The 2 times a week meetings are very beneficial for our progress
* The distribution of tasks is now better

### Adjustments for next spring

* Figure out how to use Mockito
* Increase the workload if possible
