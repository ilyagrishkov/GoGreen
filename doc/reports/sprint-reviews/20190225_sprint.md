***Sprint Review 25/02/2019***

## Goals achieved 

- Decided on Spring as a solution for server.
- Created server that is able to process a JSON string sent to it.
- Created a login window that sends a JSON string to the server.
- Passed the first demo.

## Main problems Encountered

* **Problem 1:** People are dropping out

During the first two weeks we got to know that 3 out of 7 people of the group dropped out. This made us rearrange our working priorities and fix other issues that arose with that like chairman/secretary schedule. 

* **Problem 2:** Chaos with packages and naming

While preparing for the first demo a problem of naming and redistribution of classes arose. 

* **Problem 3:** Maven

After two weeks of working with Maven and a number of issues we had with it, the decision was made to switch to Gradle. 


## Adjustments for next sprint

- Get acquainted with Gradle.
- Agree on a naming convention for packages and classes.
