***Sprint Review 04/03/2019***

## Goals achieved 

- Created database connection
- Server running on heroku in remote
- Added logger client
- Added the sidebar GUI

## Main problems Encountered

* **Problem 1:** Not enough work

Some members of the team felt they could have done more work. This does not really classify as a problem but it slowed us down compared to our internal schedule.

## Adjustments for next sprint

- Better scheduling
- Break down tasks into smaller parts to assign to people
