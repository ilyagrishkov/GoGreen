## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Lack of Communication
This week all the members agree that we lacked some communication. 

First of all, we only met once last week, therefore members were mostly working in their own corner without engaging in group communication.

### Problem 2: Still having problems to correctly assign tasks

We still had some unequal task distribution. Meaning we assigned too much work to every member compared to too little work a couple of weeks ago.

We are adjusting as the days pass.

### Problem 3: Procrastinating Merge Requests

We are having difficulties to constantly approve or discuss on Merge Requests.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Increase efforts on Merge Requests
 - Correct Task distribution
 - Agree to see ech other more often

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase testing effort
 - Working better together
